# Cursor Rules for Fact Check Project

## Project Patterns
- Video processing application for fact checking
- Uses OpenAI API for transcription and fact checking
- Frontend and backend components separate
- API key management through environment variables

## File Organization
- Frontend appears to be in video-transcription-frontend/
- Multiple potential backend components
- Uploads stored in uploads/ directory
- Python environment management with both venv and conda

## Code Style Preferences
- Separate CSS and JS in separate files
- Use modern practices for OpenAI API integrations
- Keep code clean and organized
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid code duplication

## Development Workflow
- Check for existing solutions before adding new functions
- Use focused edits
- Check for code conflicts
- Ask before creating extra scripts
- Search the web for API questions
- Don't assume API or endpoint availability

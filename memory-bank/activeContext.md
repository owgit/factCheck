# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Preparing the project for public repository
- Documentation and environment setup
- Cleaning up unused files and directories

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure
- Created env.example with placeholder values
- Updated .gitignore to exclude .env and Python-specific files
- Added uploads/.gitkeep to maintain directory structure
- Created README.md with project information and setup instructions
- Added a symbolic link .env.example in the root directory pointing to env.example
- Identified and documented unused files and directories
- Cleaned up test/sample files from the uploads directory
- Enhanced .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and test files

## Active Decisions
- Using GPT-4o (chatgpt-4o-latest) as the fact checking model
- Setting up the framework for video upload, transcription, and fact checking
- Keeping sensitive information out of the public repository
- Removing unnecessary test files and build artifacts

## Current Challenges
- Need to fully understand the existing codebase structure
- Verifying API integrations are working correctly
- Understanding the complete workflow from video upload to fact checking results
- Resolving duplicate files (install.sh)

## Next Steps
- Explore existing code to better understand implementation details
- Document the actual application workflow as implemented
- Identify any gaps between intended functionality and current implementation
- Set up a local development environment for testing
- Consider removing or consolidating duplicate install.sh scripts

## Questions to Address
- Is there a database component beyond file storage?
- What is the full user journey through the application?
- Are there any specific performance or accuracy concerns with the current implementation?
- What is the purpose of the Google API integration mentioned in .env?

# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The Fact Check application follows a client-server architecture with separate frontend and backend components:

- Frontend: Web interface for user interaction
- Backend: API service handling video processing, transcription, and fact checking
- Storage: File system for video storage

## Design Patterns
- RESTful API design for backend services
- Component-based frontend architecture
- Async processing for handling video uploads and transcription
- Service-oriented design for AI integration

## Component Relationships
- Frontend <-> Backend API: HTTP/REST API calls
- Backend <-> OpenAI API: External API integration
- Backend <-> File Storage: File system operations

## Data Flow
1. User uploads video through frontend
2. Backend processes video and sends to transcription service
3. Transcription results are processed for fact checking
4. Fact checking results are returned to frontend for display

## Security Considerations
- API key management for OpenAI services
- Secure file upload handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration to restrict access

## Scalability Approach
- Stateless backend design
- Separate concerns between upload, transcription, and fact checking
- Potential for queue-based processing for high volume

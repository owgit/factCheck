## Completed Items
- Project structure initialization
- Environment configuration (.env file)
- Memory bank setup
- Created env.example for public repository
- Updated .gitignore for security
- Added uploads/.gitkeep for directory structure
- Created README.md with project documentation
- Added symbolic link .env.example pointing to env.example
- Identified and documented unused files
- Cleaned up test files from uploads directory
- Enhanced .gitignore to exclude unnecessary artifacts
- Removed nested Git repository in video-transcription-frontend
- Initialized Git repository in root directory with 'main' branch
- Made initial commit with project files
- Centralized environment configuration (.env) in root directory
- Updated application to look for .env in root directory
- Added memory-bank to .gitignore to exclude development notes from repository

## In Progress
- Understanding existing codebase structure
- Mapping current implementation to intended functionality
- Preparing project for public sharing
- Repository cleanup

## Pending
- Full documentation of current implementation
- Verification of API integrations
- Testing of end-to-end workflow
- Performance optimization (if needed)
- Resolution of duplicate install.sh scripts

## Known Issues
- Duplicate install.sh scripts in root and video-upload-app directories
- Node.js files in Python backend directory
- Build artifacts included in version control

## Current Status
- Initial setup phase
- Project appears to be a video upload and fact-checking application using OpenAI services
- Basic environment configuration is in place and centralized in root directory
- Project is being prepared for public repository access
- Cleanup of unnecessary files in progress
- Git repository initialized and configured with 'main' branch
- Development notes (memory-bank) excluded from version control

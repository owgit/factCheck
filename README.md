## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js and npm
- OpenAI API key
- FFmpeg (for video processing)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Setup

#### Option 1: Traditional Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fact-check.git
   cd fact-check
   ```

2. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or with conda:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd video-transcription-frontend
   npm install
   ```

#### Option 2: Docker Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fact-check.git
   cd fact-check
   ```

2. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the backend container with Python and FastAPI
   - Build the frontend container with Node.js and React
   - Configure Nginx for serving the frontend and proxying API requests
   - Set up volume mapping for uploads and environment variables

4. Access the application at http://localhost

## Usage

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start the services (after making changes)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Debug Docker issues
./docker-debug.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

If you encounter issues with the Docker setup:

1. Run the debugging script: `./docker-debug.sh`
2. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Verify file permissions in containers
4. Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up
5. If necessary, rebuild containers: `docker-compose up -d --build`

- **Error: No such file or directory**: Ensure all paths in docker-compose.yml are correct and that you've created any required directories.
- **Backend can't connect to OpenAI API**: Verify your API key in the .env file is correct and that you have sufficient credits.
- **Frontend not connecting to backend**: Check the REACT_APP_API_URL in your environment variables and ensure the backend service is running.

### Instagram Integration Issues

The Instagram integration uses third-party libraries to download content from Instagram for fact-checking. Due to Instagram's measures against automated access, you may encounter the following issues:

#### Common Errors

1. **401 Unauthorized Error**: Instagram is actively blocking the connection.
   - **Solution**: Try using different Instagram credentials in your .env file.
   - **Alternative**: Download the video manually and upload it directly.

2. **"Could not find window._sharedData" Error**: Instagram has changed their page structure.
   - **Solution**: Wait for a library update or use the manual upload option.

3. **No media found after download**: The content might be private or not accessible.
   - **Solution**: Ensure you're using credentials that have access to the content.

#### Mitigation Strategies

- Increase `INSTAGRAM_MAX_RETRIES` and `INSTAGRAM_RETRY_DELAY` in your .env file
- Use an Instagram account with fewer restrictions
- If Instagram integration is critical, consider implementing a browser automation solution (like Selenium)

#### Note on Instagram's Policies

Instagram actively works to prevent automated access to their platform. The application's ability to download content may be affected by:
- Instagram's frequent API and website changes
- Rate limiting and blocking of automated requests
- Login challenges and captchas when using automated tools

### Running the Backend Server (without Docker)

```bash
cd video-upload-app
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Running the Frontend Development Server (without Docker)

```bash
cd video-transcription-frontend
npm start
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd video-transcription-frontend
npm run build
```

A video fact-checking application that automatically transcribes and verifies factual claims in uploaded videos using OpenAI's advanced AI models.

## Features

- üé¨ **Video Upload**: Support for various video formats (mp4, mov, avi)
- üîä **Automatic Transcription**: Convert speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model
- ‚úÖ **AI Fact Checking**: Verify claims using OpenAI's GPT-4o
- üîç **Image Analysis**: Extract and analyze visual content from videos
- üì± **Responsive UI**: User-friendly interface for uploading and reviewing results
- üìä **Detailed Reports**: Get comprehensive fact-check reports with sources

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python with FastAPI
- OpenAI API integration
- MoviePy for video processing
- Instagram API integration (optional)

### Frontend

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js and npm
- OpenAI API key
- FFmpeg (for video processing)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized setup)

### Setup

#### Option 1: Traditional Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fact-check.git
   cd fact-check
   ```

2. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or with conda:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd video-transcription-frontend
   npm install
   ```

#### Option 2: Docker Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fact-check.git
   cd fact-check
   ```

2. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the backend container with Python and FastAPI
   - Build the frontend container with Node.js and React
   - Configure Nginx for serving the frontend and proxying API requests
   - Set up volume mapping for uploads and environment variables

4. Access the application at http://localhost

## Usage

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start the services (after making changes)
docker-compose up -d --build

# Debug Docker issues
./docker-debug.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

If you encounter issues with the Docker setup:

1. Run the debugging script: `./docker-debug.sh`
2. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Verify file permissions in containers
4. Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up
5. If necessary, rebuild containers: `docker-compose up -d --build`

### Instagram Integration Issues

Instagram has strict measures against automated access, which may cause problems when downloading content:

1. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Ensure your Instagram credentials in `.env` are correct
   - Use a less restricted Instagram account (avoid using accounts that have had suspicious activity)
   - Try using a VPN if Instagram is blocking access from your server's IP

2. **"401 Unauthorized" Errors**:
   - Instagram occasionally blocks automated tools; this is common and expected
   - Consider using a different Instagram account
   - Wait a few hours before trying again (Instagram rate limits can be temporary)

3. **"Failed to Download" Errors**:
   - Verify the post URL is correct and accessible (test by opening it in a browser)
   - Check if the post is from a private account
   - Instagram's API changes frequently, so the instaloader library may need updates:
     ```bash
     pip install -U instaloader
     ```

4. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - If Instagram integration is critical, consider implementing a browser-based solution with Selenium
   - Implement a fallback mechanism for users to manually upload videos

### Running the Backend Server (without Docker)

```bash
cd video-upload-app
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Running the Frontend Development Server (without Docker)

```bash
cd video-transcription-frontend
npm start
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd video-transcription-frontend
npm run build
```
